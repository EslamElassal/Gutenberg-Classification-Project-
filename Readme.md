# Group 8 Data Science Applications Classification Assignment Project 
A simple and well designed structure is essential for any machine learning project, project template that combines **simplicity, best practice for CODE structure** and **good CODE design**. 
The main idea is that there's much same stuff you do every time when you start our machine learning project, so wrapping all this shared stuff will help you to change just the core idea every time you start our machine learning project. 

**So, hereâ€™s a simple readme template that help you get into our project faster and just focus on your notice and explainations, etc)**
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In order to decrease repeated code shunks, increase the time that can read the code in, flexibility an reusability we used a functional programming structure that focused on split all problems in our project in functions and use that functions many times in many places in the code without repeating the code.

In this project, we selected some books from the Gutenburg library from different categories and then select random paragraphs from them and labeled these paragraphs by the book name for ground truth. After creating the dataset we used many transformation algorithms to embed the text to numbers for the modeling processes like (TF_IDF, BOW,NGRAM)
<br><br>
After this, we tried many classification algorithms like(SVM, KNN, Decision Tree, RandomForest Classifier,GradientBoosting,Naive Base and LogisticRegression) and chose the champion one which achieved the highest accuracy.

**Recommended using GPU to compile the code much faster.
But it works well for CPU too.**
- GPU takes around 40 min, while CPU may take hours.
